# Khaldoun's architecture

Khaldoun as an organisation relies on a platform with various building blocks.

- A deployment environment (droplets & databases configured via Terraform),
  and standardised IT components (webhooks, Github Actions, Sentry).
- An analytics sandbox for exploration
  around data extraction (LabelStudio, file storage).
- A [process library](/docs/processes.md).
