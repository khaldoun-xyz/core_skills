# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun's purpose is to create fulfilling jobs.

Earning an income is a critical step in living a great life.
It provides a feeling of certainty & significance
and grants opportunities for growth & contribution.
Also, today's jobs contain the seeds of tomorrow.
Our communities will thrive,
if we help its members earn a fulfilling income.

Over time, Khaldoun will be our vehicle to build highly automated organisations.
We call them 'autonomous organisations'. In an autonomous organisation,
menial and administrative work does not require manual intervention.
This is not achievable by tweaking existing legacy systems. Instead,
*we'll specifically design organisations* to unlock scalable automation.

## Developmental stages

Khaldoun will go through a series of developmental stages
as we continue to grow. These stages are important as we
need to develop a number of fundamental building blocks
for Khaldoun to succeed.

### Stage 1: Strengthen Tunis as a talent hub

Tunis has the potential to be a hub
for training highly talented data specialists
(data scientists, data engineers, AI specialists,
product managers, devops engineers, ...).

We want to strengthen the belief that talented individuals
can come to Tunis to build great data & AI companies.
This requires setting up a training platform for talented
data specialists. To that end, Khaldoun will develop
open-source products, offer educational material and
organise ways to interact with people further along.

Our first open-source product is
<a href="https://lugha.xyz" target="_blank">Lugha</a>.
Members of Khaldoun are expected to work in international work contexts,
which typically require speaking foreign languages.
Lugha helps us evaluate the language competences of our members.

### Stage 2: Help German organisations automate

We're striving to eventually build autonomous organisations.
Autonomous organisations have successfully
automated any administrative or tedious task.
Our consulting work is a stepping stone on a way to this goal.
Tools and systems we develop will help organisations
significantly increase automation.
Wherever possible, we will open-source our technologies
to increase speed.

While we don't know the exact shape yet, it is clear that there are certain building blocks that other organisations benefit from - and not all require sophisticated machine learning techniques. Two critical building blocks will be setting up 1) a critical process library and 2) an orchestration layer that executes most of the automation tasks. 

German organisations need a push for efficiency because they have delayed digitisation and
their population is aging. Healthcare institutions in
particular are in need of jump-starting automation initiatives.

It is at this stage that Khaldoun will start placing
Khaldoun members at German organisations.

### Stage 3: Set up autonomous organisations

Once we have gained sufficient experience
building highly automated organisations,
we're ready to set up our own fully autonomous organisations. Naturally, we'll use the tools & systems that we have developed with our clients.
One potential starting point might be building a strong brand in the German long-term care industry.

At this stage, we will start supporting
Khaldoun members in setting up their own companies.
