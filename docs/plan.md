# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun helps its clients do more with less.

- **bey** is a data feed,
- **tanfidh** is an ai agent for the backoffice.

----

- We develop internal products to do more with less:
  - [**Altadaim**](https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/altadim) is a Linux
    developer setup for data scientists.
  - [**Lugha**](https://lugha.xyz) let's you evaluate your language
    skills through conversations.
  - [**Sisu**](https://sisu.cx) is a cockpit for your daily life.

----

We believe that ...

- we can innovate at low cost structures by asking different questions,
- an ecosystem doesn't come into existence all at once,
- independence is very valuable,
- letting go is very valuable.
