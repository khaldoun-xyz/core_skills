# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun is a technology company that **helps people do more with less**.
To do so, we develop and maintain open-source tools & systems.

Over time, Khaldoun will become a vehicle
to build **unbureaucratic bureaucracies** - organisations that actively
reduce complexity & orchestrate automation.
This is not possible by tweaking existing legacy systems.
Instead, **we'll specifically design organisations**.

## Developmental stages

Khaldoun will go through a series of developmental stages
as we continue to grow. These stages are important as we
need to develop a number of fundamental building blocks
for Khaldoun to succeed.

### Stage 1: Build a talent hub

At its core, Khaldoun is a technology company
that wants to foster growth for a long time.
Sustaining this core requires access
to a supply of highly-educated technologists
(e.g. software developers, data scientists, data engineers,
AI specialists, product managers, devops engineers, ...).
To that end, we will set up a training platform
to train ourselves and others.

Khaldoun will develop open-source products, offer educational
material and provide learning opportunities - all with
the goal to strengthen skills of potential Khaldoun members.

- Our first open-source product is
  <a href="https://lugha.xyz" target="_blank">Lugha</a>.
  Members of Khaldoun are expected to work in international work contexts,
  which typically requires speaking foreign languages.
  Lugha allows us to evaluate the language competences
  of our members in a highly automated fashion.

### Stage 2: Help others automate

Our strategy is to a) develop an open-source toolbox for automation & orchestration
and to b) integrate these tools at European organisations.

Core building blocks of this toolbox are ...
- i) locally hosted webforms to receive structured data
- ii) a data transformation service that extracts data from unstructured documents
- iii) an event-driven orchestration infrastructure to enable automation Ans robotics-usage.

- Our second open-source product will be a webform to
  apply for German long-term care insurance.
  Long-term care institutions can integrate the
  webform to make it easier for customers
  to apply for long-term care insurance. Over time, we'll generalise this into general purpose webforms. 

In the course of our consulting work,
it will become increasingly clear to our clients
that they benefit from technology talent within their companies.
We will offer this talent, which makes it possible
for Khaldoun members to move to Germany, if interested.
Over time, we will build a network across organisations
to provide learning opportunities for talented technologists.

### Stage 3: Set up healthcare organisation

Once we have gained sufficient experience
building highly automated organisations,
we're ready to start setting up our own organisation.
We will set up Renard, an European healthcare organisation,
that provides healthcare services.
Naturally, we'll use the tools & systems
that we have developed with our consulting clients.

Khaldoun will continue to grow as a technology company,
while Renard will start its own multi-step development.
