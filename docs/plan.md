# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun wants to **help people do more with less**.

To do so, Khaldoun aims to become a vehicle
to build **unbureaucratic bureaucracies** - organisations that
deliberately design their organisations to orchestrate automation.

## Developmental stages

Khaldoun will go through a series of developmental stages
as we continue to grow. These stages are important as we
need to develop a number of foundational building blocks.

### Stage 1: Set up a trade school for AI technologists.

At its core, Khaldoun is a technology company
that wants to foster growth for a long time.
Sustaining this core requires access
to a supply of highly-educated technologists
(e.g. software developers, data scientists, data engineers,
AI specialists, product managers, devops engineers, ...).
To that end, we will set up a trade school - khaldoun.school -
to train ourselves and others.

Khaldoun.school will offer foundational AI skills training with
the goal to increase the competence of existing and potential Khaldoun members.
Also, khaldoun.school develops open-source products to foster & evaluate 
learning.

- Our first open-source product is
  <a href="https://lugha.xyz" target="_blank">Lugha</a>.
  Members of Khaldoun are expected to work in international work contexts,
  which typically requires speaking foreign languages.
  Lugha allows us to evaluate the language competences
  of our members in a highly automated fashion.

### Stage 2: Develop a business operating system for small companies.

Big corporations have started integrating AI technologies years ago. 
In contrast, smaller companies couldn't afford the investment.
Recent technological developments make it much cheaper to introduce 
AI capabilities at a lower budget. 

Our strategy is to a) develop an open-source toolbox for 
automation & orchestration and to b) combine 
these tools into an automation-first business operating system (BOS).
The core idea behind the BOS is that we want to help owners introduce 
AI agents as virtual employees. 

Core building blocks of this toolbox are ...

- i) AI agents that process information and convert them into tasks,
- ii) AI operators that complete tasks like humans do,
- iii) a BPMN engine that makes managing these agents and operators simple and transparent.

Eventually, we'll find a way how to deploy these orchestration components quickly.
One area that is particularly in need of these solutions is the healthcare industry.

### Stage 3: Set up our own organisations.

Using our BOS, we set up organisations ourselves.
