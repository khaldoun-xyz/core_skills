# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun's purpose is to build tools & systems to do more with less,
i.e. to increase productivity.

Over time, Khaldoun will be a vehicle
to build a fully automated organisation - an 'autonomous organisations'.
In an autonomous organisation, humans are still actively involved, but
menial and administrative work does not require manual intervention anymore.
We will not achieve this level of automation by tweaking existing legacy systems.
Instead, *we'll specifically design an organisation* to unlock scalable automation.

## Developmental stages

Khaldoun will go through a series of developmental stages
as we continue to grow. These stages are important as we
need to develop a number of fundamental building blocks
for Khaldoun to succeed.

### Stage 1: Strengthen Tunis as a talent hub

At its core, Khaldoun is a technology company
that will need to maintain growth for a long time.
Sustaining this core requires access
to a supply of highly-educated technologists
(e.g. data scientists, data engineers, AI specialists,
product managers, devops engineers, ...).
To that end, we will set up a training platform
to train ourselves and others to be top technologists.

Khaldoun will develop
open-source products, offer educational material and
provide learning opportunities - all with
the goal to strengthen skills of potential Khaldoun members.

- Our first open-source product is
  <a href="https://lugha.xyz" target="_blank">Lugha</a>.
  Members of Khaldoun are expected to work in international work contexts,
  which typically require speaking foreign languages.
  Lugha allows us to evaluate the language competencies
  of our members in a highly automated fashion.

### Stage 2: Help German organisations automate

To develop the necessary skills
to set up an autonomous organisation
we will offer consulting services to help German
healthcare companies increase their automation rate.

While the exact shape is not obvious yet,
the general direction is clear.
We will initially offer our services to
long-term care institutions that are in need of automation.
Our strategy is to a) develop open-source tooling for automation
and to b) integrate this tooling with the
existing infrastructure at these organisations.
Likely starting places for automation gains will be in
i) document management, ii) robotics process automation
and iii) process organisation.

- Our second open-source product,
  <a href="https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/renard" target="_blank">Renard</a>,
  is a webform to apply for German long-term care insurance.
  Long-term care institutions can integrate it to make it easier for customers
  to apply for long-term care insurance.

In the course of our consulting work,
it will become increasingly clear to our clients
that they benefit from technology talent within their companies.
We will offer this talent, which makes it possible
for Khaldoun members to move to Germany, if interested.

### Stage 3: Set up autonomous long-term care organisation

Once we have gained sufficient experience
building highly automated organisations,
we're ready to set up our own fully autonomous organisation.
We will set up a long-term care organisation that provides
healthcare services.
Naturally, we'll use the tools & systems
that we have developed with our consulting clients.
