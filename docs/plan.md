# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun's purpose is to create fulfilling jobs. That's it.

Earning an income is a critical step in living a beautiful life.
It provides a feeling of certainty & significance
and grants opportunities for growth & contribution.
Also, today's jobs contain the seeds of tomorrow.
Our communities will thrive,
if we help its members earn a fulfilling income.

## Developmental stages

Khaldoun will go through a series of developmental stages
as we continue to grow. These stages are important as we
need to develop a number of fundamental building blocks
for Khaldoun to succeed.

### Stage 1: Strengthen Tunis as a data hub

Tunis has the potential to be a thriving hub
for highly talented data specialists
(data scientists, data engineers, AI specialists,
product managers, ...).

We want to strengthen the belief that talented individuals
can come to Tunis to build great data & AI companies.
This requires setting up a platform for talented
data specialists. To that end, Khaldoun will develop
open-source products, offer educational material and
organise ways to interact with people further along.

Our first open-source product is
<a href="https://lugha.xyz" target="_blank">Lugha</a>.
Members of Khaldoun are expected to work in international work contexts,
which typically require speaking foreign languages.
Lugha helps us evaluate the language competences of our members.

### Stage 2: Help German organisations automate

We're striving to eventually build autonomous organisations.
Autonomous organisations have successfully
automated any administrative or tedious task.
Our consulting work will reflect this.
Tools and systems we develop will help organisations
significantly reduce their dependence on manual tasks
or core IT systems.
Wherever possible, we will open-source our technologies
to increase speed.

German organisations have delayed digitisation and
the population is aging. Healthcare institutions in
particular are in need of jump-starting a drive for efficiency.
It is at this stage that Khaldoun will start placing
Khaldoun members at German organisations.

### Stage 3: Help Tunisian organisations automate

With the experience we will have gained in Germany,
we'll approach Tunisian organisations to offer
support in driving efficiency as well.

### Stage 4: Set up fully autonomous organisations

Once we will have gained sufficient experience
building highly automated organisations,
we're ready to set up our own fully autonomous organisations.
One potential starting point will be
in the German long-term care industry.
At this stage, we will also support
Khaldoun members in setting up their own companies.
