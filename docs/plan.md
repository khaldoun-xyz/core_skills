# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun's purpose is to inspire ourselves and others to do more with less.
Doing more with less is a simple definition of increasing productivity,
which seems like a useful stepping stone to live a full life, doesn't it?

Over time, Khaldoun will be a vehicle
to build fully automated organisations - doing more with less par excellence.
We call them 'autonomous organisations'. In an autonomous organisation,
menial and administrative work does not require manual intervention.
This is not achievable by tweaking existing legacy systems. Instead,
*we'll specifically design organisations* to unlock scalable automation.

## Developmental stages

Khaldoun will go through a series of developmental stages
as we continue to grow. These stages are important as we
need to develop a number of fundamental building blocks
for Khaldoun to succeed.

### Stage 1: Strengthen Tunis as a talent hub

At its core, Khaldoun is a technology company
that needs to maintain growth for decades.
Sustaining this core requires access
to a supply of highly-educated technologists.
To that end, we will train ourselves and others
to be top technologists.
And we will do it in Tunis.

Tunis has the potential to be a hub
for training highly talented technologists
(e.g. data scientists, data engineers, AI specialists,
product managers, devops engineers, ...).
To tap into this potential, we will set up
a training platform for talented
technologists. Khaldoun will develop
open-source products, offer educational material and
provide learning opportunities - all with
the goal to strengthen skills of potential Khaldoun members.

Our first open-source product is
<a href="https://lugha.xyz" target="_blank">Lugha</a>.
Members of Khaldoun are expected to work in international work contexts,
which typically require speaking foreign languages.
Lugha allows us to evaluate the language competencies of our members in a highly automated fashion.

### Stage 2: Help German organisations automate

Autonomous organisations have successfully
automated any administrative or tedious task.
We will offer consulting services to help German
companies increase their automation rate.

While the exact shape is not obvious yet,
the general direction is clear.
We will initially offer our services to smaller
long-term care institutions that are in need of automation.
Our strategy is to a) develop open-source tooling for automation
and to b) integrate this tooling with the
existing infrastructure at these organisations.

Likely starting places for automation gains will be in
i) document management, ii) robotics process automation
and iii) process organisation.

In the course of these transformation activities,
it will become increasingly clear to our clients
that they benefit from technology talent
within their companies.
We will offer this talent, which makes it possible
for Khaldoun members to move to Germany, if interested.

### Stage 3: Set up autonomous organisations

Once we have gained sufficient experience
building highly automated organisations,
we're ready to set up our own fully autonomous organisations.
Naturally, we'll use the tools & systems
that we have developed with our clients.
One potential starting point might be building
a strong brand in the German long-term care industry.

At this stage, we will start supporting
Khaldoun members in setting up their own companies.
