# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun wants to **help people do more with less**.

To do so, Khaldoun aims to become a vehicle
to build **unbureaucratic bureaucracies** - organisations that
deliberately design their organisations to orchestrate automation.

## Developmental stages

Khaldoun will go through a series of developmental stages
as we continue to grow. These stages are important as we
need to develop a number of foundational building blocks.

### Stage 1: Set up a trade school for AI technologists.

At its core, Khaldoun is a technology company
that wants to foster growth for a long time.
Sustaining this core requires access
to a supply of highly-educated technologists
(e.g. software developers, data scientists, data engineers,
AI specialists, product managers, devops engineers, ...).
To that end, we will set up a trade school - khaldoun.school -
to train ourselves and others.

Khaldoun.school will offer foundational AI skills training with
the goal to increase the competence of existing and potential Khaldoun members.
Also, khaldoun.school develops open-source products to foster & evaluate 
learning.

- Our first open-source product is
  <a href="https://lugha.xyz" target="_blank">Lugha</a>.
  Members of Khaldoun are expected to work in international work contexts,
  which typically requires speaking foreign languages.
  Lugha allows us to evaluate the language competences
  of our members in a highly automated fashion.

### Stage 2: Develop CareOS, a business operating system for long-term care.

The German healthcare system is demographically challenged.
We're in the middle of a storm already and will see further cost increases.
The situation is especially dramatic in the long-term care industry.

Our strategy is to a) develop an open-source toolbox for automation & orchestration
in the long-term care industry and to b) combine 
these tools into an automation-first operating system (OS).

Core building blocks of this toolbox are ...

- i) an AI agent that processes documents,
- ii) an AI agent that handles tasks for care workers (e.g. documentation),
- iii) simple interfaces to receive structured information (e.g. online applications).

Eventually, we'll find a way how to deploy these orchestration components quickly.
Once we've reached this stage, we'll approach newly started long-term care organisations 
to help them integrate our OS in infancy. We will also use it to set up our own 
healthcare organisations.

### Stage 3: Set up healthcare organisations.

Using our OS, we set up highly automated healthcare organisations.
