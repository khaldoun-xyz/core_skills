# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun wants to **help people do more with less**.

- **school.khaldoun is a trade school for AI technologists**.
  We teach our members practical skills, provide learning opportunities
  and place talented members at European organisations.
- **os.khaldoun is an AI automation company**.
  We develop low-cost solutions to help small companies
  integrate AI into their processes.
- **health.khaldoun is a healthcare cost reduction company**.
  We develop solutions to help reduce the escalating cost burden
  of European health insurance systems.

AI technologists are able to derive value from Machine Learning techniques.
They could carry many titles, e.g. software developer, data scientist, data engineer,
AI specialist, product manager, devops engineer, mlops engineer and many more.

- We publish DIY guides, e.g. to set up an effective setup for AI work.
- We develop open-source tools & do freelance AI work to provide learning opportunities.
  - Our first open-source product is
    [Lugha](https://lugha.xyz).
    Some members of Khaldoun will work in international work contexts,
    which typically requires speaking foreign languages.
    Lugha allows us to evaluate when a member is ready to work directly with a client.
- If one of our members is interested and talented,
  we help him or her find a job at a company in Europe.

## health.khaldoun

Healthcare costs have been escalating in Germany.
This trend will accelerate over the next 10 years.
We want to provide services to help decelerate it.
