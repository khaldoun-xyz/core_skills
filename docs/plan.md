# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun is an automation & data collection company.
We help our clients do more with less.

- We develop complementary services that help insurers do more with less:
  - Bey is a data service for insurers. Subscribers get ...
    - an insurer-centric data feed
      (e.g. tied agent data, local company PR, a talent database)
    - an AI robot platform that lets you transparently automate manual work.
  - To fund our operations we consult insurers in process automation.
- We develop internal products to do more with less:
  - [**Altadaim**](https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/altadaim) is a
    Linux developer setup for data scientists.
  - [**Sisu**](https://sisu.cx) is a suite of tools that
    are scaffolding for high productivity.
  - [**Lugha**](https://lugha.xyz) let's you evaluate your foreign language competence.

We believe that ...

- avoiding the competition is much easier than beating the competition,
- we can innovate at low cost structures by asking different questions,
- an ecosystem doesn't come into existence all at once,
- independence is very valuable,
- having an edge through better data is much easier than through better skill.
