Khaldoun helps its clients do more with less.
Our primary focus is supporting AI transformation activities.

Working at Khaldoun means that you have full access to a Khaldoun membership.
Our primary purpose is facilitating change. This is why our membership
is geared towards continuous learning and excellence.

We develop internal products for our members:

- [**Altadaim**](https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/altadim) is a Linux
  developer setup for data scientists.
- Qalib (wip) is a git repo template
  to give structure to our work.
- [**Lugha**](https://lugha.xyz) let's you evaluate your language
  skills through conversations.

We believe that ...

- independence is very valuable,
- we can innovate at low cost structures by asking different questions,
- an ecosystem doesn't come into existence all at once,
- letting go is very valuable.
