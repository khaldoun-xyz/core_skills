# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun is a Tunisian-German AI boutique. We help our clients do more with less.

- Our primary focus is initiating & supporting AI transformation activities.
  - We develop the insurance agency of the future.
    For this, we directly collaborate with tied agents.
    - **bey** monitors activities of tied agents across the industry,
    - **tanfidh** is an ai agent for the backoffice.
  - We build tooling to help fix our healthcare crisis.
    - **XYZ** automates activities in the long-term care space,
    - **renard** is our education service to learn skills quickly.
- Our secondary focus is developing our member' skills.
  This is inner work. For this, we develop internal products for our members:
  - [**The Handbook**](https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/handbook) is our guide for
    new members that spells out our way of working.
  - [**Altadaim**](https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/altadaim) is our
    Linux developer setup.
  - [**Assaas**](https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/assaas) is a
    git repo template
    to give structure to our work.
  - [**Lugha**](https://lugha.xyz) lets us evaluate our
    language skills through conversations.
  - [**Sisu**](https://sisu.cx) is our pacing device.

We believe that ...

- independence and minimal costs are closely linked,
- an ecosystem doesn't come into existence all at once,
- in the long-term we win.
