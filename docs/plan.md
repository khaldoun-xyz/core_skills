# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun is an open exploration.  
We don't know where we'll end up.
But we do know we want to help people **do more with less**.

- explore.khaldoun **provides money & time to explore**.
  In the course of our explorations, we develop open source products.
- ai.khaldoun develops **AI workers for small business owners**.
  This is where we want to make money to keep going.

In the course of our explorations, we develop open source products:

- [**Lugha**](https://lugha.xyz) let's you evaluate your foreign language competence.
- **Altadim** is an opinionated AI tool stack for your Linux computer.
  Set it up with one command.
- **Fireside** is a video interview series to generate ideas & inspiration.

ai.khaldoun develops **AI workers for small business owners**.  
This is how we want to make money to keep going.

- As a counter point to expensive high-end computers,
  the makers of the Raspberry Pi have been trying
  to make computers as affordable as possible.
- At the budget of a small US school district, Sal Khan built Khan Academy,
  one of the biggest non-profit learning platforms in the world.

While elite AI companies fight for GPUs and talent,
we might be able to ask different questions to come up with different ideas.
*What can we do with no GPUs and no talent?*
