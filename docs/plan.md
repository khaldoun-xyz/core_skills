# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun helps its clients do more with less.

- Our primary focus is initiating & supporting AI transformation activities.
  - **bey** is a data feed,
  - **tanfidh** is an ai agent for the backoffice.
- Our secondary focus is developing a membership programme.
  Our membership is a fast track for doing more with less.
  We develop internal products for our members:
  - [**Altadaim**](https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/altadaim) is a
      Linux developer setup for data scientists.
  - [**Assaas**](https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/assaas) is a
      git repo template
      to give structure to your work.
  - [**Lugha**](https://lugha.xyz) lets you evaluate your
      language skills through conversations.
  - [**Sisu**](https://sisu.cx) is your pacing device.

----

Things we'll never do:

- We will never develop products with your data behind your back.
- We help you be great. We will never sell your accomplishments as ours.

----

We believe that ...

- independence and minimal costs are closely linked,
- an ecosystem doesn't come into existence all at once.
