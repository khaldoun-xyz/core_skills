# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun is an automation & data collection company for insurance companies.

- We develop complementary services that help insurers do more with less:
  - **Task2execute** will be a platform to transparently deploy automated robots.
  - **Scrape** will be a web scraping platform for extracting insurer-relevant data.
  - **Recruit** will be a recruiting & training platform
    for placing & retaining special talent.
  - **Health** will be a suite of health services to reduce healthcare costs.
- To fund our operations we consult insurers in process automation.
- We develop internal products to do more with less:
  - [**Lugha**](https://lugha.xyz) let's you evaluate your foreign language competence.
  - [**Altadim**](https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/altadim) is an AI dev setup
    for your Linux computer that you can install with one command.
  - [**Sisu**](https://sisu.cx) is a suite of tools that
    are scaffolding for high productivity.

We believe that ...

- avoiding competition is much easier than beating competition,
- we can innovate at low cost structures by asking different questions,
- an ecosystem doesn't come into existence all at once,
- independence is very valuable,
- having an edge through better data is much easier than through better skill.
