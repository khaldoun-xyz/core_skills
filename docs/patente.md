# Why is a Patente useful?

A "Patente" gives you a legal status to be self-employed and earn money. Additionally, a Patente lets you employ up to 3 individuals. Specifically, a Patente offers:

- **Legal Protection**: Enables individuals to operate within a legal framework, avoiding fines or penalties.
- **Access to Financial Services**: Facilitates opening a business bank account, applying for loans, and accessing other financial benefits.
- **Tax Benefits**: Offers clarity on tax obligations and access to applicable deductions or incentives.

# How to Get a Patente for IT Services

1. **Specify Patente**: Define the business type (e.g., IT services), income sources (Dinars or foreign currency), and target clients (inside or outside Tunisia).
2. **Prepare Documents**: ID, Domiciliation (a paper document stating the official address of the office, registered with the municipality, provided by the patent holder and location owner), university diploma in IT or related fields, and a government credit clearance document (a document from Tunisian tax authorities proving you have no unpaid taxes or government debts.).
3. **Register the Business**: Apply Online to the **RNE (Registre National des Entreprises)** to get the unique business identifier [using this link.](https://www.registre-entreprises.tn/rne-public/#/)
4. **Approval Process**: Attend an interview, wait for confirmation, and receive the Patente and unique identifier.
5. **Pay Fees**: Complete the required registration payments.

# What to Consider?

1. **Business Scope**:  
   - Ensure the Patente covers all your activities.  
   - Charges apply to those working with Tunisian clients and providing local services (up to 19% VAT), not for "totally export-oriented" Patentes.

2. **Tax Obligations**:  
   - **Monthly Tax**: 20 DT, with accurate filing of necessary documents (typically managed by an accountant).  
   - **Yearly Tax**: 400 DT (exempted for Patentes opened in **2024 or 2025** for the four years following the year of opening)

3. **Accounting Service**:  
   - Hire an accountant to handle tax declarations, manage finances, and ensure compliance with regulations.

4. **Continuous Renewal**:  
   - Renew the Patente annually by proving all taxes were declared and paid on time. For beginners, it is easiest to use an accountant for this step.

5. **CNSS Contributions**:  
   - Open a **non-salaried account** with CNSS (Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale). As a patent owner, you're considered a non-salaried individual. Visit a CNSS office with your patent ID, proof of domiciliation(official office address document, as mentioned earlier), and personal ID to complete the process.  
   - Pay **9.68% of net income** quarterly as social security contributions.
