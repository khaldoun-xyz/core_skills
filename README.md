# Internal memo for new Khaldoun members

Welcome to the team!

Khaldoun wants to help its members do more with less.
It sounds easy, but it isn't. It requires hard work!

We want you to be the surfer who uses a wave to move forward effortlessly.
Whether you get there is up to you.

## Our plan with Khaldoun

[Our plan](/docs/plan.md) is usually outdated.
Still, it's a good guide to better understand our thinking.

## Systems that help us

We deliberately integrated certain behaviours
because they give us speed and focus
while maintaining independence and creativity.

You can see the full list of our processes at <https://sisu.cx/processes>.
