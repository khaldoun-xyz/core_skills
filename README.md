# Internal memo for new Khaldoun members

Welcome to the team!

Khaldoun wants to help its clients do more with less.
And we hope you'll help make that a reality.
Therefore, at first we want to help *you* do more with less.
We want you to be the surfer who uses a wave to move forward effortlessly.

## Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun is an automation & data collection company for insurance.
We help our clients do more with less.
[Our plan](/docs/plan.md) is usually outdated.
Still, it's a good guide to better understand our thinking.

## Systems that help us

We deliberately integrated certain behaviours
because they give us speed and focus
while maintaining independence and creativity.

You can see the full list of our processes at <https://sisu.cx/processes>.
