# Internal memo for new Khaldoun members

Welcome to the team!

Khaldoun wants to help its members do more with less.
It sounds easy, but it isn't. It requires hard work!

We want you to be the surfer who uses a wave to move forward effortlessly.
Whether you get there is up to you.

## Our plan with Khaldoun

[Our plan](/docs/plan.md) is usually outdated.
Still, it's a good guide to better understand our thinking.

## Our tech stack

Check out [Altadaim](https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/altadaim)
to get a better understanding of how we think about our tech stack.

## Best practices

We ask you to adapt to our best practices.
If you think our way of working can be improved,
please suggest improvements to our workflows.

- We documented how we collaborate in ou [Workflow handbook](./docs/workflow_handbook.md).
- We documented how we use version control in our [Git handbook](/docs/git_handbook.md).

## Systems that help us

We deliberately integrated certain behaviours
because they give us speed and focus
while maintaining independence and creativity.
